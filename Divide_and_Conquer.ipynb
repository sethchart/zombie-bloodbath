    "Therefore, this last contestant has no one to fight and the merge is over.\n",

    "Using the notation, $F(1) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things from getting messy, I am going to concede one more fight than I need to and just say that merging the two sorted teams into a sorted list of $k$ integers takes no more than $k$ fights, even though we know that $k-1$ will always get the job done.  \n",

    "If I put this together, I find out that the number of fights required to sort a list with $k$ integers satisfies the equation below.\n",

Don't forget that there are two teams, hence two times $F\\left(\\tfrac{k}{2}\\right)$.\n",
